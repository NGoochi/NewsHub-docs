üßæ NewsHub ‚Äî Definitions (v0.1)

A living lexicon describing the structural, conceptual, and functional elements of the NewsHub project.
This file ensures consistent terminology across code, prompts, and UI development.

üîß Project Overview

Project Name: NewsHub
Purpose: A webapp that searches, catalogues, and analyses news articles using external APIs (NewsAPI, Gemini) and stores results in a local database (PostgreSQL via Prisma).
Primary Use Case: Provide structured insights into media coverage by summarising and classifying articles, identifying key stakeholders, and exporting data for external analysis (e.g., Google Sheets).

üß† Core Processes
Article Import (Session-based)

A multi-step workflow for importing news articles from NewsAPI.ai with progress tracking.

Steps:

1. **Preview**: User submits search parameters (keywords, sources, date range). Backend queries NewsAPI.ai to estimate article count and validate sources.

2. **Start Import**: Creates an ImportSession record with status "running". Process executes asynchronously, fetching articles in batches and saving to database.

3. **Monitor Progress**: Frontend polls session status endpoint to display real-time progress (articlesFound, articlesImported).

4. **Completion**: Session status updates to "completed" or "failed". Articles are linked to both Project and ImportSession for traceability.

Input: search terms, source URIs, date range, optional boolean query

Output: ImportSession ID, article counts, status updates

Source Management

A system for filtering and selecting news sources for imports.

Behaviour:

SearchSource table stores available news sources with metadata (region, country, language)

Frontend can query available sources, countries, and languages

Users select specific sources or use all active sources

Selected source URIs are passed to import requests

Gemini Analysis (Batch-based)

A structured process where articles are grouped into AnalysisBatch records and processed through Gemini API for summarisation, categorisation, sentiment, and quote extraction.

Workflow:

1. **Create Batch**: User selects up to 10 articles. System creates AnalysisBatch with status "pending".

2. **Start Processing**: Backend updates status to "running", fetches article content, sends to Gemini.

3. **Dual Analysis**: Each batch performs both article analysis (summary, category, sentiment) and quote extraction in sequence.

4. **Database Update**: Results are parsed and saved to Article records (summaryGemini, categoryGemini, sentimentGemini) and Quote records.

5. **Completion**: Batch status updates to "completed". Progress tracked via processedArticles / totalArticles.

Input: project ID, array of article IDs (max 10)

Output: AnalysisBatch ID, status updates, analysis results

Behaviour:

Runs on user request for selected articles

Executes asynchronously with progress tracking

Can be cancelled mid-process

Multiple batches can be created for large projects

Export

Converts the full Project dataset (Articles + Quotes) into a Google Sheets file.
Creates two tabs: Articles and Quotes.
Handles authentication via Google OAuth.

Note: Implementation exists but requires verification of Google Sheets API integration.

Input Method
Describes how an article entered the system. Can be newsapi, manual, or csv.

Analysis Status
Whether an article has been analysed (analysedAt not null).

Import Session
A tracked workflow instance representing a single article import operation from NewsAPI.ai, allowing users to monitor progress and review import history.

Analysis Batch
A group of up to 10 articles processed together through Gemini API for efficiency. Tracks progress and stores results.

Source URI
A unique identifier for a news source in NewsAPI.ai format (e.g., "bbc.co.uk", "nytimes.com").

Boolean Query
Advanced search syntax for NewsAPI.ai allowing complex keyword combinations (AND, OR, NOT operators).

Session-based Import
Import workflow pattern where operations are tracked via ImportSession records, enabling async processing with progress monitoring.

Batch Processing
Analysis workflow where multiple articles (max 10) are sent to Gemini in a single API request for efficiency and cost optimization.

System I/O Contract
An admin-only specification defining the strict JSON schema Gemini must follow when returning analysed data for insertion into the database. Defined in prompt templates (article-analysis.md, quote-analysis.md).
